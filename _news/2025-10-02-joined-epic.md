🎉 I have joined the EPIC Lab at Shanghai Jiao Tong University as a research assistant! I will be exploring acceleration strategies for diffusion-based large language models, including **remasking techniques** and **reinforcement-learning-driven optimization methods**. Looking forward to this exciting journey ahead!
